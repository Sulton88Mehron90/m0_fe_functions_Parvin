# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

* I tend to spend time on reading and understanding the topic. I should work on reducing the time spent on that. Although it's getting better because I start my day early.I prioritise my tasks. I focus on one thing at a time and limit distractions and take frequent breaks from difficult tasks. *

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is? 
* Say you want to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Make them describe each action to you, one step at a time. Write these down. When it comes time to open the first jar make them describe.

Hold the jar in one hand.
Grab the lid in the other.
Turn your lid hand counter clockwise.
When you have to open the other jar, rather than making them repeat these steps say â€œlet's reuse the steps for the first jar. Call that 'open jar X'. Where X is which jar you want to open. *

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters. 

* Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition.
Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.*

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group? 
* Return Values *
